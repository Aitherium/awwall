"""Publish-time moat guard — inspect the BUILT wheel and sdist before PyPI.

This is the last gate before bytes leave the building, and it asks its question
of the artifact rather than the tree. That distinction is the whole point: the
source can be spotless while the build is not. A stray `hatch` include, a file
left in the working tree at build time, or an sdist that ships what the wheel
excludes are all invisible to a source scan and all reach the user.

`python -m build` publishes BOTH a wheel and an sdist, so both are inspected.
The sdist is the usual offender, because exclusion rules are commonly written
for the wheel and quietly do not apply to it.

Rules:
  * **MOAT001** no monorepo import (`lib.`, `services.`, `from AitherOS`). awrise
    is standalone by contract; one of these is a `ModuleNotFoundError` on a
    stranger's machine, and the plugin seam exists precisely so fleet integrations
    attach from OUTSIDE the published package.
  * **MOAT002** no internal identifier — debt-row ids, checker rule ids, absolute
    monorepo paths. No secret scanner fires on these because none is a credential;
    what leaks is the SHAPE of the platform, under a permissive licence.
  * **MOAT003** the keystone modules are PRESENT. A guard that only looks for bad
    things passes an EMPTY artifact perfectly, which is the most dangerous thing
    it could do — an empty wheel installs fine and every import fails at runtime.
    This is the positive assertion that makes the other two meaningful.

Exit: 0 clean, 1 a rule failed, 2 could not judge (no artifact, unreadable
archive) — never 0 for "I could not look".

    python scripts/check_moat_boundary.py [dist/awrise-*.whl dist/*.tar.gz ...]

With no argument it picks the newest wheel AND the newest sdist in `dist/`.
